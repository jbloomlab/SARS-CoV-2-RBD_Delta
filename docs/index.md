# Interactive structural visualizations of escape mutation maps

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the Delta SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on recognition by polyclonal plasmas from individuals who were infected with the Delta variant.

These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/).
These experiments are described in **this pre-print**, and raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_Delta/blob/main/results/supp_data/aggregate_raw_data.csv).

Sites of escape are shown for each antibody, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD structure ([PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J).


These interactive `dms-view` renderings show mutations that reduce binding of polyclonal plasmas to the Delta RBD.

Below are previously-published interactive `dms-view` renderings for early 2020 plasmas. These plasmas were mapped against DMS libraries of the homologous RBD of exposure -- i.e., the Wuhan-Hu-1 RBD.

(2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821000822) can be found [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera/). Participants were recruited for the [HAARVI study](https://www.chulab.org/haarvi) in the Seattle, WA area.

Participants were recruited in the New York area and these samples were first described in [Robbiani, et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2456-9).

Below are previously-published interactive `dms-view` renderings for primary Beta infection-elicited plasmas. These plasmas were mapped against DMS libraries of the homologous RBD of exposure -- i.e., the Beta RBD.
  - `dms-view` links for a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 Beta-convalescent individuals from [Greaney, et al. (2022)](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010248) can be found [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_B.1.351/). Plasmas from individuals infected with the B.1.351 (Beta) variant were first described in [Cele, et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03471-w).
